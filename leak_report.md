# Leak report

_In this project, there is one C file to be considered for leaks: 'clean_whitespace.c'. Through memory analysis with the command valgrind, we can see that there is indeed a memory leak in the code. 46 bytes of data in 6 blocks is being used upon exit, with a total heap usage of 7 allocations, 1 frees, at a limit of 1,070 bytes. These 46 bytes of data are shown to be lost at line 41, where a slot is allocated for all the saved characters with calloc. Three functions use the allocated slot at different times, producing the problem: strip, is_clean, and main._

_To revise the code so that the memory leak is patched, we should turn to the space after result is set to an integer value for the comparison of the string and the cleaned string (i.e, line 68, is_clean method). At this point, there is no need to manipulate cleaned further; thus, the space can be deallocated for cleaned, should it not be empty. An if statement can be set up for checking to see if cleaned is empty, and if it is not, free(cleaned) can be used to free up the space allocated to it. As soon as the program terminates, no extra memory will remain allocated for us; the memory leak shall be solved. _
